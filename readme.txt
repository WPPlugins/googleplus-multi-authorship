== Description ==
GooglePlus Multi-Authorship provides a straightforward solution to properly add Google+ Authorship markup to the head of each post and page on a multi-authored site.

It follows the recommended use of the rel="author" link tag to point to a Google+ profile as described in [this FAQ](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2013/08/relauthor-frequently-asked-advanced.html) on Google's official webmaster blog.

* It adds only the rel="publisher" link tag on the home page, front page and archive pages
* It adds both the rel="author" and rel="publisher" on single posts and pages.
* The appropriate author's Google+ profile is used for each single post and page.
* You can set a default Google+ profile to be used as a fallback if there's no Google+ profile specified for an author in his WP user profile settings.

For questions and support, please post them at the [plugin page](http://nimrodflores.com/googleplus-multi-authorship). I can't provide quick help if you post your questions in the forum as I am not always in the forums.
